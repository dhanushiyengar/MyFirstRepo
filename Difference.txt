Array list:

1) An array list is a collection of items stored at contineous memory locations. 
2)Here there are multiple elements of same type are stored together. 
3) Here the limitation of the array list is that the size of the array is predifined.
4) Arrays are slow when compared to linked list.
5) Good for sorting and accesing.


Linked list:

1) Linked List are linear data structures where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations.
2) Every element is a separate object with a data part and address part. 
3)The elements are linked using pointers and addresses.
4) Each element is known as a node. 
5)Due to ease of insertions and deletions, they are preferred over the arrays.
